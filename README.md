# Parachute Joust

Simple two-player arcade game implemented with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

Players leap from a plane and battle over a shared parachute on the way down to a barnyard full of sheep.  The pilots now flop about like rag dolls and whoever is holding the parachute bag clutches it in their arm and falls a bit slower.  The game also features a cartoony airplane, sheep grazing near the barn, and basic synthesized sound effects for the plane, wind and impacts.

## Controls
- **Red player**: A/D (left/right), W/S (slower/faster fall)
- **Blue player**: ←/→ (left/right), ↑/↓ (slower/faster fall)

Press **Enter** to start or play again.

## Running
